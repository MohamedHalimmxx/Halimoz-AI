## Halimoz AI Video Intelligence Summarizer
A multi-agent AI system for understanding, summarizing, and documenting video content using natural language.

Overview
AI Video Intelligence Summarizer is an AI-powered application that transforms any video into a **complete, educational understanding**.

Instead of watching long videos, users provide a video URL and receive a **well-structured summary**, with an **optional full script**, and a **downloadable PDF**, all through a ChatGPT-like interface.

---

Problem
Long-form video content presents several challenges:

• Time-consuming to watch  
• Hard to extract key ideas  
• Difficult to revisit specific explanations  
• No clean documentation format  

This leads to wasted time and inefficient learning.

Solution
A multi-agent AI system that:

• Extracts audio from any video URL  
• Transcribes speech automatically  
• Understands and explains the content deeply  
• Optionally generates the full script  
• Produces a clean PDF summary  

All using **free and open-source AI tools**.
